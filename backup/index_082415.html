            <p>“<b>Culture</b>: Few drinks can claim a place in the creation of the English, American, French and Russian revolutions, but coffee can. Beyond activating the minds of revolutionaries, coffee drinking is highly social, and for centuries coffeehouse owners have tried to make their businesses centers of community life.”<br>

            	<p>Koffee’s initial startup was successfully funded in November of 2014 through the popular crowd funding site; Kickstarter. 100 indivuals collectively put together $30,000 in 30 days, proving that there is a strong desire for a healthier coffee. <b>Koffee</b> concentrates its rich flavor in a 6 ounce espresso style sipper.

            <p>Koffee was inspired by Kody Chaet, an educational plant-based chef and lifestyle transformation coach, who sought to grow the world through the art of healthier food and beverage. He grew up a vegetarian and avid animal activist near Yellowstone, Montana. As a young entrepreneur, Kody pursued multiple careers in the health and wellness industry. He started n Portland, OR as a personal fitness trainer and smoothly transitioned into the private chef world in Los Angeles, CA. After a decade as a health and fitness professional, he decided he wanted to spread his gift of healing to the world as a whole. Kody realized the best way to spread his message of health to the masses, was to reinvent everyones favorite health beverages, starting with coffee, the most popular beverage on the Planet Earth!</p>

                                <p>The first commercial alkaline ionic water ionizers were available in Japan in l958. At first, only very large units were used in hospitals. In 1985, the household unit was introduced in the United States. Many scientific studies have been conducted to investigate just how drinking ionized water can give the consumer beneficial effects every day that they drink it. Alkaline ionized water is produced through the water electrolysis process that creates "restructured/reduced/micro-clustered water." This makes the water more readily available. It also raises PH value (note that anything greater than 7.0 can be considered alkaline water.)  Athletes use alkaline water with a high pH to counteract muscle fatigue caused by lactic acid build-up. Drinking ionized water also has demonstrated anti-aging effects as well as prevention of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, ulcers and arteriosclerosis. It has even found that an alkaline with a pH of 8.8 can be considered an adjunct in the treatment of acid reflux disease. According to the national heartburn alliance of the estimated 54 million Americans suffer from heartburn. 75% say Coffee causes it. . By cold-brewing coffee with alkaline water, you’re creating a less acidic and less harsh experience on the stomach. When we brew coffee with alkaline water, we are completely reinventing the coffee experience.</p>

                                    <p>Cold Brewing is an ancient Peruvian process Todd Simpson brought it to America in 1964 from Peru. It is done by steeping coffee grounds for a extended a period of time vs. short bouts. In a nutshell, time replaces heat. Because hot water doesn't’t penetrate the coffee gournds, the acidic oils from the coffee bean are not released and transferred into the liquid mixture. This creates anywhere from 65% - 80% less acidity. Heat brewed coffee is usually at a PH of 5 or lower.  For every one ounce of coffee drink you would need to drink 20 ounces of water to completely neutralize acidity created in the body. Koffee strives to keep the pH between 6 & 8, which means our coffee ranges from minimally acidic, neutral or “pH balanced”, to slightly alkaline. Because acidity is connected to many degenerative illnesses, This means our low acid Koffee is easier on the stomach, joints and energy levels.</p>

                                    <p>We utilize a Coconut Milk creamer, which is dairy, soy, gluten and cholesterol free. Coconuts contain significant amounts of fat, but unlike other nuts, they provide fat that is mostly in the form of medium chain saturated fatty acids (MCFAs). MCFAs are rapidly metabolized into energy in the liver and because of this, tt is thought that unlike other saturated fats, MCFAs are used up more quickly by the body and are less likely to be stored as fat. MCFAs are also shown to be antiviral and antibacterial and can destroy a wide variety of disease causing organisms. Science has proven over and over again the benefits of drinking a plant-based milk over animal milks. On top of all the health benefits, comes the dramatically lighter carbon footprint left on earth’s environment. Plant milk is better for your body, your environment, and of course the peaceful cow.  </p>

                                    <p>Next to tobacco, coffee is sprayed with more chemicals than any other product consumed by humans. Coffee is one of the largest and most important crops in the world, worth roughly $16.5 billion in the United States alone. Organic coffee only accounts for 6.6% of the world’s harvest though. We are without a doubt living in one of the most toxic times in human history. It is more important now than ever to choose a path of health and pay close attention n to what is in our foods so we know what’s going into our bodies. Amongst the greatest threats to our human health is the chemicals sprayed on our food. Pesticides have been linked to a number of health problems, including neurologic and endocrine (hormone) system disorders, birth defects, cancer, and other diseases. By ditching conventionally grown foods, we are ditching the risk of these</p>

                                    <p>Traditionally, all coffee was shade grown. As the coffee beans mature more slowly in the shade, natural sugars increase and enhance the flavor of the coffee. Shade grown coffee is most often organically grown, free of chemical use. Shade grown coffee requires little or no chemical fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides. The shade trees also filter carbon dioxide which causes global warming, and aid in soil moisture retention which minimizes erosion. Shade grown coffee is not only better for the environment, but also for earths creatures. Migrating bird populations have been in rapid decline since the introduction of "sun" coffee and the consequent destruction of rainforest for more coffee plantations. As many as 150 species of birds have been identified on shade coffee farms. Shade coffee farms are, for the most part, organic and sustainable.</p>
